      <div>The Backrooms are the most famous example of a liminal space. They're a mysterious, 600 million square 
        mile large building floor consisting only of walls. You can enter the backrooms by accidentally 
        "no-clipping" out of reality and instantly appearing somewhere in the expanse of the backrooms. 
        The backrooms originated from a 4chan post made in May 2019, which detailed the basic concept of the
        backrooms and included the iconic image of the backrooms. There have been many interpretations 
        and adaptations of the backrooms concept, the most famous of which is a YouTube series by Kane Pixels, 
        with its pilot episode getting tens of millions of views. The image which inspired the backrooms was taken
        in 2002 in a furniture store under renovation in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.</div>

      <div>The Pool Rooms are a spinoff of The Backrooms, containing a seemingly endless number of rooms with pools.
        In some interpretations, the water in the pool rooms should not be swam in, as the water is infested with 
        deadly bacteria and viruses. Some lore says the pool rooms are on a different floor from the backrooms 
        and can be accessed from them.</div>

      <div>This image was taken in a Holiday Inn Express hotel in London which was made famous for its unique 
        interior design. The image is of the recreational section of the hotel which is covered by a ceiling,
        rather than the typical choice of a hole which lets in natural light.
